# Educational Project: CSS Animation and Keyframes

## Repository Description
In this educational project, I focus on a crucial aspect of web development - CSS animation and keyframes. I explore and apply the following concepts and techniques:

- **CSS Animation and Keyframes**: I delve into CSS animation properties and keyframes to add interactive and dynamic elements to my web pages. With CSS animation, I create captivating visual effects and transitions.

- **Animation Practice**: Through practical exercises, I gain hands-on experience in creating various animated elements and effects. I experiment with different timing functions, duration settings, and animation properties to enhance user interaction.

Using CSS animation and keyframes, I expand the possibilities of web design and create captivating effects that grab users' attention and enhance their browsing experience.

Happy coding!
